    ///     the user's response.

    ///     If `true`, the card will be moved to the next box. If `false`, the card
    ///     will be moved back to the first box.

    /// The method performs the following steps:
    /// 1. Finds the card in its current box by matching its `id`.
    /// 2. Removes the card from its current box.
