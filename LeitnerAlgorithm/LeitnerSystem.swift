    /// - Parameter boxAmount: The number of boxes to initialize the system with.
    ///   If the provided value is less than 2, the system will default to 2 boxes.
    ///   This ensures that there is a minimum of two boxes to support the basic
    ///   functionality of the Leitner System. Defaults to 5.
    ///
    /// Example Usage:
    /// ```
    /// let system = LeitnerSystem(boxAmount: 7) // Creates a system with 7 boxes
    /// let defaultSystem = LeitnerSystem()      // Creates a system with the default 5 boxes
    /// ```

    /// of the spaced repetition algorithm. Ensure that the number of boxes aligns
    /// with your intended use case.

    ///
    /// - Parameter card: The `Card` object to be added to the system.
    ///
    /// The card is added to the first box (box 0) upon creation. This is the starting
    /// point for new cards in the Leitner system. As the user interacts with the card
    /// and provides correct or incorrect answers, the card will be moved between
    /// boxes based on the spaced repetition algorithm.
    ///
    /// Example Usage:
    /// ```
    /// let card = Card(id: UUID(), word: word, lastReviewed: Date(), reviewInterval: 1)
    /// let system = LeitnerSystem()
    /// system.addCard(card) // Adds the card to the first box
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Note: Ensure that the card provided is valid and properly initialized.
    /// The system assumes that new cards start in the first box and will handle
    /// moving the card between boxes based on user interactions.

        boxes[0].append(card)  // Start card in the first box
    }
    
    /// Updates the status of a card based on whether the user's answer was correct or incorrect.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - card: The `Card` object to be updated. The system will locate this card
    ///     in its current box and modify its position based on the correctness of
    ///     the user's response.
    ///   - correct: A Boolean value indicating whether the user's answer was correct.
    ///     If `true`, the card will be moved to the next box. If `false`, the card
    ///     will be moved back to the first box.
    ///
    /// The method performs the following steps:
    /// 1. Finds the card in its current box by matching its `id`.
    /// 2. Removes the card from its current box.
    /// 3. Moves the card to the next box if the answer was correct, or back to the
    ///    first box if the answer was incorrect. The box index is constrained to
    ///    valid ranges (i.e., between 0 and the total number of boxes - 1).
    ///
    /// Example Usage:
    /// ```
    /// let card = Card(id: UUID(), word: word, lastReviewed: Date(), reviewInterval: 1)
    /// let system = LeitnerSystem()
    /// system.addCard(card)
    /// system.updateCard(card, correct: true) // Moves the card to the next box
    /// system.updateCard(card, correct: false) // Moves the card back to the first box
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Note: Ensure that the `card` provided is correctly initialized and exists
    /// in one of the boxes. This method assumes that the `card` is present and
    /// will not handle cases where the card is not found.
